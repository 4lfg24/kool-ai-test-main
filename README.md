# kool-ai-test-main
 
Welcome to Kool-ai, a small library I made to simulate intelligient movement behavior inside a 3d world, made for the kool game engine.
This library is still a work in progress and will be subject to many changes in the future, and I'm more than open to suggestions.
The goal of this library is to be used inside a physics world and to do that you must use a 
``` MovementEntity ``` which contains multiple ```MovementPrograms```, the library includes an example on how to extend the ```MovementEntity``` and a basic use case. For any questions and/or suggestions you can ask in the Issues sections of this page or directly at Kool's discord server: (https://discord.gg/GvsJj2Pk3K)
